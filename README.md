# Employee-Tracker

https://github.com/dcho10/Employee-Tracker

## Description

  
The purpose of my app is to: Create an employee database system where user can add employees/roles/departments, view employees/roles/departments, or updating employee roles.
  
The app is intended for: Users who would like to keep track of the employees and roles/departments for their company.
  
The reason I created the app is: To enhance user experience and provide a employee management database
  
Some victories I experienced include: Figured out how to get the prompt running, creating select options rather than input values
  
Some challenges I experienced include: Generating the tables in the terminal
